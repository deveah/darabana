	Darabana
	A minimal percussion software synthesizer
	--


	Overview
	--

	Darabana is a simple software synthesizer which is aimed at generating
percussion instruments. It can output .wav files, usable across any modern
Digital Audio Workstation.

	Synth
	--

	The synthesizing algorithm is composed of two oscillators, a sine and a
white noise one, both of which are controlled by similar parameters, such
as amplitude, decay, frequency for the sine, and color for the noise. The sine
oscillator also includes frequency decay as a parameter.
	The waveforms are then combined, and passed through a comb filter, which
aims at emulating the instrument's acoustic chamber.

	Export
	--

	Darabana can export .wav files through libsndfile, which are by default
32-bit floats, with only one audio channel.

	Presets
	--

	Presets are simply lists of parameters, separated by spaces. This format
was chosen specifically to be editable with any text editor. It was also the
easiest to implement.
